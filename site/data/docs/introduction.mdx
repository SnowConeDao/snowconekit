SnowConeKit is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) library that makes it easy to add wallet connection to your dapp. It's intuitive, responsive and customizable.

### Features

#### Wallet management

Out-of-the-box wallet management for your dapp. Aside from handling the connection and disconnection of wallets, SnowConeKit supports numerous wallets, swaps connection chains, resolves address to ENS, displays balance and much more!

#### Customizable

You can tweak the SnowConeKit UI to match your branding. You can pick from a few pre-defined accent colors and border radius configurations. For more advanced use cases, you can provide in a fully custom theme, render your own button and omit certain features. Dark mode included.

#### Industry standards

For better interoperability with most products, we rely on [ethers](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js) and [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) ‚Äî the most commonly used libraries in the space.
